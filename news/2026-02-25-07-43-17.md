## TOP SCORER OF THE DAY

**Gemini 3.1 Pro + Anthropic Enterprise Agents GA — Score: 10/10**

Why this score: Two seismic events define this period. Google shipped Gemini 3.1 Pro (Feb 19) — the strongest reasoning model available by benchmarks, scoring 77.1% on ARC-AGI-2 (double its predecessor), leading 13 of 16 key benchmarks, and 59.0% SciCode. Simultaneously, Anthropic shipped Cowork Plugins to GA (Feb 24) with 11 open-source enterprise plugins, private plugin marketplaces, Google Drive/Gmail/DocuSign connectors, and OpenTelemetry observability — converting the $285B "SaaSpocalypse" disruption signal into production enterprise traction. Claude Code Security (Feb 20, 500+ zero-days, cybersecurity flash crash) and the Agentic Coding Trends Report (60% of dev work now AI-assisted) compound the signal. The CTO's model selection matrix just got meaningfully harder: Gemini for reasoning, Claude for enterprise agent workflows, both production-ready.

- **Industry shift**: Leaders predict 2026 is the year ambient AI moves from documentation to "agentic workflows" — autonomous clinical action.

**Impact on You:**
- *Ambient is table stakes*: Epic (built-in), athena (free), Oracle (voice-first orders). Documentation AI is no longer a differentiator.
- *Pivot to action*: The value has shifted entirely to autonomous clinical action — order creation, care plans, referrals, prior auth.

**Disruption Score: 9/10** — Ambient documentation is commoditized. All voice AI investment must target autonomous clinical action.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Submit HHS HTI-5 comments by February 27 (2 days).** Removes 34/60 ONC certification criteria. Eliminates AI model cards for CDS. Submit at [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/HHS-ONC-2025-0005-0001).

2. **Patch n8n to version 2.5.2 immediately.** 8 high-to-critical CVEs in your automation platform. Expression evaluation and file access vulnerabilities are critical for any HIPAA environment.

3. **Run Claude Code Security against PMS codebase.** 500+ zero-days found in open-source. Multi-stage verification reduces false positives. Enterprise/Team access available now.

4. **Evaluate Gemini 3.1 Pro via API for clinical reasoning.** 77.1% ARC-AGI-2. 69.2% MCP Atlas (multi-step tool coordination). Compare against Opus 4.6 on specific PMS workflows.

### This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Read the Anthropic Agentic Coding Trends Report and benchmark your team.** 60% AI-assisted work is the industry baseline. Use Rakuten/TELUS/Zapier case studies to set adoption targets.

6. **Evaluate Qwen 3.5 for on-premise agentic workflows.** 397B MoE, 17B active. Fastest-growing open model family. Optimized for multi-agent orchestration.

7. **Build first PMS Cowork plugin prototype.** Fork the [knowledge-work-plugins repo](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins). Build a clinical documentation or order management plugin.

8. **Prototype MedGemma 1.5 for clinical imaging workflows.** 3D CT/MRI, whole-slide pathology, longitudinal imaging. MedASR for medical dictation.

### This Month

9. **Complete 6-model open-weight healthcare AI stack evaluation.** Qwen 3.5 (agentic) + Gemma 3 27B (multimodal) + MedGemma 1.5 (clinical/imaging) + MedASR (medical dictation) + Voxtral Transcribe 2 (speech) + Kimi K2.5 (vision).

10. **Prepare for Commerce Department March 11 state AI law evaluation.** The evaluation will identify "burdensome" state AI laws including potentially Colorado and Texas TRAIGA. Affects your compliance roadmap.

11. **Pivot voice AI strategy to autonomous clinical action.** Epic AI Charting (native), athenaAmbient (free), Oracle (voice-first orders) have commoditized documentation. Future value is in order creation, care plans, referrals.

12. **Enable GitHub Agent HQ with Gemini 3.1 Pro.** Four frontier models (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot) in one IDE. Assign best model per task. Included with Copilot Pro+/Enterprise.

## MARKET CONTEXT

1. **The model wars have entered the multi-front era — no single lab dominates across all dimensions.** Google leads reasoning benchmarks (Gemini 3.1 Pro, 77.1% ARC-AGI-2, 13/16 benchmarks). Anthropic leads enterprise agents and security (Cowork Plugins GA, Code Security, $2.5B ARR). OpenAI leads inference speed (Codex-Spark, 1000+ tok/sec on Cerebras). Alibaba leads open-weight adoption (Qwen 3.5, 600M+ downloads). CTOs must now maintain multi-model strategies rather than betting on a single provider.

2. **AI-assisted development has crossed the 50% threshold — the productivity unlock is measurable.** Anthropic's Agentic Coding Report provides the first authoritative industry benchmark: 60% of developer work is now AI-assisted, 57% of organizations use multi-step agents, and companies like TELUS have saved 500K hours. This is no longer anecdotal — it's the new baseline for engineering productivity measurement.

3. **The cybersecurity industry faces its own AI disruption moment.** Claude Code Security's 500+ zero-days triggered a cybersecurity stock flash crash. Traditional SAST/DAST vendors face the same disruption that ambient AI brought to clinical documentation — AI reasoning outperforms rule-based approaches. Snyk's endorsement signals the incumbents see complementarity rather than replacement, but the cost structure of vulnerability detection just changed permanently.

4. **Open-weight healthcare AI now covers every clinical modality.** MedGemma 1.5 (3D imaging + pathology + medical records), MedASR (medical dictation), Voxtral Transcribe 2 (general speech), Kimi K2.5 (vision), Qwen 3.5 (agentic coding), Gemma 3 27B (multimodal) — a complete 6-model stack is deployable on-premise for full HIPAA compliance. The "we can't run AI locally because the models aren't good enough" argument is officially retired.

5. **The regulatory calendar is compressed — three major milestones in four months.** HTI-5 comment deadline (Feb 27), Commerce Department state AI law evaluation (March 11), Colorado AI Act enforcement (June 30). The federal deregulatory posture creates opportunity for health IT innovation, but state enforcement (Texas TRAIGA active now) means compliance-by-default remains the only safe strategy.
