## TOP SCORER OF THE DAY

**Anthropic Ecosystem Acceleration — Score: 10/10**

Why this score: In a single two-week period, Anthropic released Sonnet 4.6 (Feb 17, 79.6% SWE-bench, 72.5% OSWorld — approaching human-level computer use), shipped 13 enterprise MCP plugins at "The Briefing" (Feb 24), acquired Vercept for computer-use capabilities (Feb 25), closed a $30B Series G at $380B valuation (Feb 12), and saw Spotify publicly confirm that its top engineers haven't written code since December — with 650+ AI-generated code changes merged monthly via Claude Agent SDK. This is not momentum; this is an organization executing on every axis simultaneously. For healthcare: HIPAA self-serve Enterprise, Cowork plugin marketplace with admin controls, and Claude Code Security all remain active.

**What Changed:**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Feb 17)**: Full model upgrade across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. 79.6% SWE-bench Verified. 72.5% OSWorld — approaching human-level on computer use tasks (up from <15% in late 2024). 1M token context window in beta with automated context compaction. Priced at $3/$15 per million tokens — same as Sonnet 4.5.
- **Vercept Acquisition (Feb 25)**: Acquired Seattle AI startup Vercept, founded by former AI2 researchers. Vercept built "Vy," a cloud-based computer-use agent operating a remote MacBook. Team joining Anthropic engineering. Vercept product shutting down March 25. UiPath stock fell 3.6% on the news — market sees AI agents as direct RPA competitors.
- **$30B Series G (Feb 12)**: Closed at $380B post-money valuation — second-largest venture deal ever (after OpenAI's $40B). Led by Coatue and GIC. Microsoft and Nvidia participated. ARR climbed to $14B (up from ~$10B). More than doubled valuation since September.
- **"The Briefing" (Feb 24)**: Virtual enterprise event. 13 new MCP connectors: Google Drive, Calendar, Gmail, DocuSign, Apollo, Clay, Outreach, SimilarWeb, MSCI, LegalZoom, FactSet, WordPress, Harvey. Prebuilt plugin templates for HR, finance, legal, engineering, operations. Private plugin marketplace with admin controls. Thomson Reuters CoCounsel reached 1M users.
- **Spotify Case Study (Feb 12)**: Spotify's "Honk" system built on Claude Agent SDK. 650+ monthly PRs merged to production. 90% reduction in engineering time. Top developers haven't written code since December. Engineers request changes from Slack on mobile; code is written, tested, and delivered for merge before they arrive at the office.
- **Claude Code Security**: Research preview continuing to expand. Enterprise access widening.

**Impact on You:**
- *Sonnet 4.6 as default*: At $3/$15 with 79.6% SWE-bench, Sonnet 4.6 should become your default for cost-sensitive workflows. Reserve Opus 4.6 for complex reasoning. The 72.5% OSWorld score means computer-use tasks (form filling, EHR navigation) are approaching viability.
- *Vercept signals RPA disruption*: If you've considered RPA tools for healthcare workflow automation, AI agents are now the clear trajectory. Anthropic is investing directly in making Claude operate computers like humans.
- *Spotify's Honk as a blueprint*: Study the Claude Agent SDK + Slack + sandboxed container architecture. This is the template for AI-assisted PMS development.
- *Cowork enterprise plugins*: The private plugin marketplace with admin controls addresses enterprise governance concerns for healthcare deployments.

**Disruption Score: 10/10** — Adopt Sonnet 4.6 as default model. Study Spotify's Honk architecture. Evaluate Cowork enterprise plugins for workflow automation.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Submit HTI-5 comments TODAY by 5 PM ET** — Last chance to influence the removal of CDS AI model card requirements and 70% certification criteria reduction. Use [HealthIT.gov submission portal](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/health-data-technology-and-interoperability-astponc-deregulatory-actions-unleash-prosperity).

2. **Adopt Claude Sonnet 4.6 as default model** — 79.6% SWE-bench at $3/$15. Near-Opus performance at 1/5 the cost. Reserve Opus 4.6 for complex reasoning-heavy tasks. Switch cost-sensitive workflows immediately.

3. **Study Spotify's "Honk" architecture** — Claude Agent SDK + Slack + sandboxed containers. [Spotify case study](https://claude.com/customers/spotify) + [TechCrunch coverage](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/spotify-says-its-best-developers-havent-written-a-line-of-code-since-december-thanks-to-ai/). Blueprint for AI-assisted PMS development.

4. **Evaluate GitHub Agent HQ at Business tier** — Claude + Codex now available for Copilot Business/Pro (as of yesterday, Feb 26). Lower barrier for team-wide multi-agent coding.

### This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Evaluate Cowork enterprise plugins** — 13 MCP connectors with private marketplace controls. Assess Google Workspace, DocuSign integrations for non-clinical workflow automation.

2. **Prototype Spotify-style AI development workflow** — Agent teams + worktrees + Claude Agent SDK + Slack integration. Target: one agent on backend, one on frontend, one on security review, all parallel.

3. **Reframe voice AI strategy** — Ambient documentation is commoditized (Epic free + athenahealth free). Pivot focus toward agentic clinical workflows: prior auth automation, referral generation, quality measure extraction.

4. **Review MCP governance options** — Evaluate Microsoft's policy-as-code framework and Airia MCP Gateway (1,000+ integrations) for healthcare-grade MCP deployment with audit logging and change detection.

### This Month

1. **Verify TRAIGA compliance** — Texas AI law is actively enforced. Ensure AI disclosure requirements are met on date of care. $10K-200K penalties.

2. **Prepare Colorado AI Act impact assessments** — Deadline June 30, 2026. Begin risk-based impact assessments for high-risk AI systems.

3. **Evaluate Qwen 3.5 + open-weight stack for on-premise** — Coding (Qwen 3.5) + reasoning (Mistral Large 3) + speech (Voxtral Transcribe 2) + clinical (MedGemma 1.5) = complete HIPAA-compliant local deployment stack.

4. **Monitor Danaher-Masimo regulatory approval** — If Masimo sensors are in your RPM integration plans, track acquisition progress and potential partnership terms changes.

## MARKET CONTEXT

**Ambient AI has become a commodity; the new value is what happens after documentation.** Epic and athenahealth giving away ambient scribing for free to 200K+ combined providers signals that ambient documentation is now a feature, not a product. The next value layer is agentic — what the AI does with the documented data (prior auth, referrals, coding, quality measures). ViVE 2026 confirmed this shift.

**Anthropic is building the first true enterprise AI platform, not just a model company.** In two weeks: Sonnet 4.6 model, Vercept computer-use acquisition, 13 enterprise MCP plugins, $30B funding at $380B, Spotify case study with 650+ monthly production PRs. This is platform-level execution across models, tools, enterprise, and ecosystem.

**Multi-agent development is crossing from experiment to enterprise standard.** GitHub Agent HQ expanding to Business/Pro tier, VS Code 1.109 with dedicated per-agent context windows, Spotify's Honk in production at scale, Claude Code agent teams — the development paradigm has shifted. Teams that don't adopt multi-agent workflows will fall behind on velocity.

**MCP governance is maturing from protocol to enterprise infrastructure.** Microsoft's policy-as-code, Airia's 1,000+ integrations with audit logging, Anthropic's 13 enterprise connectors — MCP is no longer a developer curiosity. It's on executive agendas (CIO magazine coverage) and needs proper governance (inventory management, change detection, version pinning).

**Healthcare AI investment is fragmenting into specialized verticals.** Voize ($50M, nursing), Prosper AI ($5M, admin voice), Artera ($65M, patient communication), Ambience ($243M, documentation) — the market is no longer "healthcare AI" but distinct segments: ambient clinical, ambient nursing, admin voice, patient communication, revenue cycle, prior auth. Each with different technology requirements and go-to-market strategies.
